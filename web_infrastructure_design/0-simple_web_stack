1. Single server (IP 8.8.8.8) hosting all components.
2. DNS: The A record for `www.foobar.com` points to IP 8.8.8.8.
3. Web server (Nginx): Handles HTTP(S) requests, serves static content, redirects dynamic requests to the application server.
4. Application server: Executes server-side code (PHP, Python, etc.) to generate dynamic content and interact with the database.
5. Database (MySQL): Stores persistent data (users, products, etc.).
6. User → server communication:
   - The user enters `www.foobar.com` → DNS resolves the IP 8.8.8.8.
   - Nginx processes the request and serves the files.
   - If dynamic data is required, the request is passed to the application → response returned by Nginx.
   
Problems:
1. SPOF (Single Point of Failure): If the server fails, everything is inactive.
2. Downtime during maintenance (server restart).
3. No horizontal scalability to handle high traffic.
