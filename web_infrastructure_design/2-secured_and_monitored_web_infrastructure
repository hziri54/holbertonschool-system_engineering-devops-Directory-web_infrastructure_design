1. Firewall

    3 firewalls (one per server): Protect each server by filtering incoming and outgoing traffic, blocking malicious requests, and preventing unauthorized access.

    Positioned between users and servers, firewalls ensure that only legitimate traffic can reach the infrastructure.

2. SSL Certificate

    An SSL certificate is installed on the load balancer to serve traffic via HTTPS.

    Why HTTPS?: HTTPS encrypts the traffic between the user and the server, protecting sensitive data (passwords, banking information) against man-in-the-middle attacks.

3. Monitoring Clients

    3 monitoring clients (e.g., Sumologic, Prometheus) are installed on each server.

    These clients collect performance metrics (CPU usage, memory, QPS) and send them to a centralized monitoring system for analysis and alerting.

4. Load Balancer (HAProxy)

    Distributes traffic between web and application servers.

    SSL Termination: The SSL certificate is installed at the load balancer level, and traffic is decrypted there before being forwarded to backend servers.

5. Web Server (Nginx)

    Handles incoming HTTP(S) requests, serves static files, and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.

6. Application Server

    Executes the site's business logic (PHP, Python, Node.js, etc.).

    Communicates with the database to retrieve or modify data.

7. Database (MySQL â€“ Primary-Replica Cluster)

    Primary (Master): Handles write operations.

    Replica (Slave): Handles read operations to distribute the load and improve performance.
