1. Load Balancer (HAProxy)

    Distributes traffic between web/app servers.

    Algorithm: Round-robin (even distribution of requests).

    Active-Active setup: All servers are active simultaneously.

2. Web Server (Nginx)

    Handles HTTP(S) requests, serves static files.

    Forwards dynamic requests to the application server.

3. Application Server

    Executes business logic (PHP, Python, Node.js, etc.).

    Communicates with the database to retrieve/modify data.

4. Database (MySQL – Primary-Replica Cluster)

    Primary (Master): Handles write operations.

    Replica (Slave): Handles read operations to reduce load on the Primary.

5. Application Files

    The source code of the site (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.).

Issues:

    Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

        The load balancer and the database can become single points of failure.

    Security Issues:

        No firewall, no HTTPS → unencrypted data transmission.

    Lack of Monitoring:

        No alert system in place → potential undetected downtime.
